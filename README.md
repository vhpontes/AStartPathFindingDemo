# A* Pathfinding Demo

### An Efficient Path to Knowledge

This repository contains a simple, visual demonstration of the **A* (A-Star) search algorithm**, one of the most popular and efficient pathfinding algorithms used in computer science and game development. The goal is to provide a clear and interactive way to understand how A* works to find the shortest path between two points while avoiding obstacles.

---

## What is A*?

The A* algorithm is a smart search algorithm that finds the shortest path between a starting node and a target node in a weighted graph. It balances between moving towards the goal and minimizing the total distance traveled, making it a highly optimized solution for navigation problems.
